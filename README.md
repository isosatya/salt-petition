## Petition signing project, part of coding bootcamp at SPICED (2019)

This project is the fist one where we as students learned to integrate both frontend and backend, along with the use of SQL and other Node modules.
The project is simply about signing up or a random cause, where user can create a profile with their basic information and include a "handmade" signature. The list of other users that also signed up can be then displayed to the current users, after he actually signs up. The principle of signing up and stayed logged in is then used as a basic feature for subsequent social media type projects which were done.
